### APIs to define calculated task input and output locations

TBD - This release builds on the `Provider` concept added in Gradle 4.0 to add conveniences that allow plugins and build scripts to define task input and output locations that are calculated lazily. For example, a common problem when implementing a plugin is how to define task output locations relative to the project's build directory in a way that deals with changes to the build directory location later during project configuration.

- Added `Directory` and `RegularFile` abstractions and providers to represent locations that are calculated lazily.
- Added a `ProjectLayout` service that allows input and output locations to be defined relative to the project's project directory and build directory. 
- `Project.file()` and `Project.files()` can resolve `Provider` instances to `File` and `FileCollection` instances.
- Added `AbstractTask.newOutputDirectory()` and `newOutputFile()` and `newInputFile()` methods to allow the input and output locations of tasks to be configured using these new types. Gradle will infer task dependencies based on task inputs configured this way.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Changes to task output directory creation

Gradle now creates task output directories and the parent directory for task output files consistently, regardless of whether the task output is defined using an annotated task property or using the `TaskOutputs` API. Previously Gradle would create these directories for task outputs defined using an annotated task property.  

These directories are now only created for tasks that have actions defined, so that declaring an output for a task with no actions has no effect.
